This is our Midterm Activity for Electives 2 - Machine Learning using Linear Regression and Logistic Regression for datasets about Stock Market and Iris Classification respsectively.

## **Introduction**
Overview Of Linear and Logistics Regression

**Linear regression** is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It's used for prediction and understanding relationships between variables. The equation for this regression is

Where:
- Y is the dependent variable or the output
- X1​,X2​,...Xn is the independent variable
- β0​ is the intercept 
- And β1​,β2​,...βn​ are coefficient of the independent variable

Applications for this kind of regression are predicting outcomes that are continuous(e.g., temperature, humidity,**stock prices**)



**Logistic regression** on the other hand is used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression models a binary dependent variable. The equation for this regression is

Where:
- ln(p/1-p) is the probability outcome
- X1​,X2​,...Xn is the independent variable
- β0​ is the intercept 
- And β1​,β2​,...βn​ are coefficient of the independent variable

Applications for this kind of regression are disease prediction, yes or no output or any binary outcomes


## **Dataset Description**
### Menlo Therapeutics Stocks

This dataset is about the stock price of Menlo Therapeutics from January 25, 2018 to April 1, 2020. The **open** column is the opening stock price, the **high** column is the highest stock price of that day, the **low** column is the lowest price of that day, the **close** column is the stock price in the end of the day, the **adj close** is the adjusted value of the close value and volume is the number of shares or contracts **traded** in that timeframe.

Below is the preview of the dataset to be used in **linear regression**

### Iris Flower Classification


## **Objective**

The objective of the analysis of **Menlo Therapeutics Stocks** is to predict the closing value of stock price of Menlo Therapeutics and test the prediction accuracy of using linear regression based on the following parameters;
- Opening stock price of the day
- Highest/peak stock price of the day
- Low/valley stock price of the day and
- Volume of exchanges in the given timeframe
